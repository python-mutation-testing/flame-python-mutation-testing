The majority of air-to-air combat in Vietnam was within visual range (\\\"WVR\\\").  Consider, the limited computer and networking technologies of the time.  [This is an F-4 cockpit](http://www.f4phantomparts.com/fotos/COCKPITS/F4BG.jpg), to give you some idea of what they were working with (not 100% sure that that's a Vietnam era one, but it should be close enough).  The radar largely just told you *something* was out there.  They had to get in close to visually confirm it's an enemy aircraft, rather than a friendly or civilian one.  This forced the majority of air to air combat to be WVR.  Moreover, air to air missiles were brand new at the time and very ineffective at BVR ranges.  In contrast, [look at today's F-35's cockpit](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b15fc3375736baeeff23d26ddf1049f3683dd7dc/c=0-183-3600-2217\\u0026r=x1683\\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635687698024036598-2K0B5613.jpg) - straight up videogame-style radar showing you were the goodguys and badguys are.  The goodguys computers all talk to each other to know who is where, [civilian aircraft are much easier to track](https://flightaware.com/), and various fancy signal work can identify an enemy aircraft type by the radar return to confirm it's an enemy combat aircraft.  WVR visual identification is far, far less important.  Additionally, we've had decades of work on BVR missiles.  There's a bit of a rivalry, for example, between American and European BVR missiles - forums like f-16.net love to discuss how the AMRAAM stacks up against the Meteor.\\n\\n- Losses to Vietnam MiGs were due to a combination of a large number of issues.\\n    - One of the issues was limited situational awareness.  Most of the F-4 losses were from MiGs attacking *from behind*, where the F-4 pilots didn't know they were about to be attacked.  The F-35's was *heavily* influenced by this knowledge.  It has an *incredible* sensor suite to help the aircraft know what's going on, networks heavily with other aircraft to effectively expand its own sensors immensely, and really fancy computer hardware/software to process, digest and feed the information to the pilot.  Moreover, it flips the situation around: the F-35's stealthiness minimizes the *opponents* situational awareness.  The F-35's radar can also act as a jammer.\\n    - Poor training.  Most of the air-to-air combat training the US did was against other, similar aircraft.  US Navy F-4 pilots trained against other F-4s, or maybe F-8's, and that's about it.  Going up against the very different MiGs left them unprepared.  Strategies developed against F-4s don't work as well against MiG-17s.  Additionally, there was insufficient training for WVR combat strategies; the training overly emphasized the BVR combat that they didn't end up utilizing in actuality (maybe this is what you were thinking of?).\\n\\n\\u003E and the subsequent creation of top gun?\\n\\nTOPGUN was created to resolve the bullet point I had above about training.  TOPGUN pilots trained not only against their own kind of aircraft, but also things like T-38s.  [Did you know today's US Navy has F-16s](http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display\\u0026key=7797A073-812B-41D3-842A-206C6B6EB0B6)?

Moreover, air to air missiles were brand new at the time and very ineffective at BVR ranges.  In contrast, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b15fc3375736baeeff23d26ddf1049f3683dd7dc/c=0-183-3600-2217\\u0026amp;r=x1683\\u0026amp;c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635687698024036598-2K0B5613.jpg\\\"\\u003Elook at today\\u0026#39;s F-35\\u0026#39;s cockpit\\u003C/a\\u003E - straight up videogame-style radar showing you were the goodguys and badguys are.

WVR visual identification is far, far less important.  Additionally, we\\u0026#39;ve had decades of work on BVR missiles.  There\\u0026#39;s a bit of a rivalry, for example, between American and European BVR missiles - forums like f-16.net love to discuss how the AMRAAM stacks up against the Meteor.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ELosses to Vietnam MiGs were due to a combination of a large number of issues.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cul\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EOne of the issues was limited situational awareness.  Most of the F-4 losses were from MiGs attacking \\u003Cem\\u003Efrom behind\\u003C/em\\u003E, where the F-4 pilots didn\\u0026#39;t know they were about to be attacked.  The F-35\\u0026#39;s was \\u003Cem\\u003Eheavily\\u003C/em\\u003E influenced by this knowledge.  It has an \\u003Cem\\u003Eincredible\\u003C/em\\u003E sensor suite to help the aircraft know what\\u0026#39;s going on, networks heavily with other aircraft to effectively expand its own sensors immensely, and really fancy computer hardware/software to process, digest and feed the information to the pilot.  Moreover, it flips the situation around: the F-35\\u0026#39;s stealthiness minimizes the \\u003Cem\\u003Eopponents\\u003C/em\\u003E situational awareness.  The F-35\\u0026#39;s radar can also act as a jammer.\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003Cli\\u003EPoor training.  Most of the air-to-air combat training the US did was against other, similar aircraft.  US Navy F-4 pilots trained against other F-4s, or maybe F-8\\u0026#39;s, and that\\u0026#39;s about it.  Going up against the very different MiGs left them unprepared.  Strategies developed against F-4s don\\u0026#39;t work as well against MiG-17s.  Additionally, there was insufficient training for WVR combat strategies; the training overly emphasized the BVR combat that they didn\\u0026#39;t end up utilizing in actuality (maybe this is what you were thinking of?).\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n\\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003Eand the subsequent creation of top gun?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETOPGUN was created to resolve the bullet point I had above about training.

incoming nuclear strike from the USA. He did not have the authority to order a nuclear response. What he did do was choose not to follow hard and fast protocol to call and report the detection up the chain of command to his military higher-ups and members of the Soviet Politburo as he had been ordered to do once a detection had taken place.\\n\\nThis incident occurred on September 26, 1983. In that incident, Stanislav Petrov was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Soviet Air Defense Forces who was serving as the senior duty officer in charge of the command center at a Soviet early warning bunker (known as *\\\"Serpukhov-15\\\"*). \\n\\nDuring his duty shift that day, the Soviet Union's *Oko* early-warning satellite system made a detection that it erroneously interpreted as being an incoming ballistic missile launch from the United States. Thankfully, Petrov did not believe the warning to be authentic, and going against well established procedures, he refused to immediately notify his higher-ups in the military or Politburo political apparatus.\\n\\nInterestingly, the reason Lieutenant Colonel Petrov did not believe the launch warning datastream coming in from the *Oko* satellite was because luckily, he had actually been heavily involved in monitoring the development of the Soviet *Oko* early warning satellite constellation since its earliest design days (due to his rank and expertise, he was the top military liaison between the Soviet Air Defense Forces and the satellite design and testing team during the satellite's development), and he knew it was a very poor, unreliable system and could not be trusted because, contrary to what the Soviets publicly claimed about *Oko* at the time, it was highly prone to the threat of giving false-positive detections.\\n\\nThe *Oko* satellite constellation did not actually detect the initial launch of a nuclear missile, but rather their orbital placement had these sats flying in highly elliptical [\\\"Molniya\\\" orbits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit). This orbital profile allowed the satellites to observe the United States missile fields from high-oblique \\\"look angles\\\", meaning they observed the target area from the side rather than overhead, looking for telltale infra-red signatures from the rocket motors. Rather than using radar or looking to detect a missile visually as it launched, the idea behind *Oko* was that once the nuclear missile had reached high altitude and its look angle breached the Earth's horizon in relation to the *Oko* satellite, *Oko's* onboard IR detection system would be able to pick out the heat signature from the rocket propelling the missile as it burned hot and bright against the cold stellar backdrop of space. Or, at least that is how it was supposed to work.\\n\\nIn the case of this famous incident, there happened to be some high-altitude clouds above the US missile fields that this specific *Oko* sat was monitoring at the time, and due to the coincidental location of the sun at this instant, these cloud tops actually reflected the sunlight directly at the *Oko* satellite onboard IR sensor array. The *Oko* satellite sensors detected that sudden infra-red bright spot \\\"bloom\\\" and, as it was programmed to do, the early-warning satellite interpreted that as an incoming missile and triggered the alarm.\\n\\nColonel Petrov was notified of the detection immediately since he was the senior duty officer at *Serpukhov-15*, and due to his past experience with and understanding of the very low reliability of the *Oko* system, and from the fact that it was initially only detecting a single IR bloom (signifying only one initial missile detection as opposed to a salvo of many missiles), he concluded that it was most certainly a false positive detection situation. He decided to wait for radar confirmation (which of course never came) before going up the chain of command with the news, and part of the reason for that, Petrov has admitted since, is because he was not sure due to the political climate at the time how the Soviet Politburo political leadership in charge would react. At the time of this incident, tensions between the USA and USSR were rather high, and had been increased further just a few weeks prior because the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, killing 269 civilian passengers and crew.\\n\\nIn regards to this incident, it is worth noting that unlike the USA, the Soviets did not have extensive near-global radar confirmation capability at that time (and they really still don't). Petrov had to actually wait for quite awhile after the *Oko* satellite sounded the initial incoming launch alarm that was triggered by its IR sensors before the nuclear missile (which did not exist) would have been close enough to Soviet-controlled airspace that they would have a direct line-of-sight on it to use radar to either confirm the incoming missile, or confirm the *Oko* detection as a false positive. Obviously, that radar confirmation of an incoming missile never came because there was no incoming missile.\\n\\nPetrov's real heroics in that incident was waiting for the radar confirmation before going up the chain of command. He has stated in interviews since that he was sure it was a false positive, and was not at all surprised when the radar screen never picked up a track of anything incoming. At the time, there was a lot of strife within the Soviet political apparatus, and Petrov was well aware of that in-fighting that was going on due to his position as a high-ranking military officer. He simply did not trust the ability of the Politburo higher-ups to (in just the few short minutes they would be given to react) properly weigh the evidence, take into account the reality that the *Oko* constellation design flaws were so great that the satellites could not be trusted to provide accurate data, then make the correct decision and chose not to order a retaliatory strike before the supposed incoming non-existent missile struck Soviet territory. The MAD doctrine and Soviet planned counter-response to a US first strike scenario required that the USSR try to get at least a portion of their retaliatory strike fired off before any incoming missiles impacted their soil, and Petrov felt that more than a few politicians and military men would have pushed hard to order the launch of a retaliatory strike in those few short minutes they would have had to decide.\\n\\nWhat really took a lot of balls was when the *Oko* alarms went off at *Serpukhov-15* and Petrov - a career military man - deliberately chose to not follow the very explicit orders he had which demanded he pick up the red phone and immediately notify Moscow that one of the early-warning satellites was signaling a launch detection and incoming missile from the USA. He knew that HUGE act of disobedience could have ended his career in a heartbeat once it was found out (and maybe even put him in a gulag somewhere in Siberia), but he also knew the signal from the *Oko* bird had a very high probability of being a false positive and that there was no real threat.\\n\\nLuckily, after the news of this false positive detection incident came out, many within the Politburo realized that punishing Petrov for disobeying his orders would have negative propaganda results, and since his decision was the right one, they ended up letting his disobedience slide. \", \"edited\": false, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"body_html\": \"\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003ETo clarify, Stanislav Petrov did not actually make a decision not to fire nuclear weapons in response to a false positive detection of an incoming nuclear strike from the USA. He did not have the authority to order a nuclear response. What he did do was choose not to follow hard and fast protocol to call and report the detection up the chain of command to his military higher-ups and members of the Soviet Politburo as he had been ordered to do once a detection had taken place.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis incident occurred on September 26, 1983. In that incident, Stanislav Petrov was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Soviet Air Defense Forces who was serving as the senior duty officer in charge of the command center at a Soviet early warning bunker (known as \\u003Cem\\u003E\\u0026quot;Serpukhov-15\\u0026quot;\\u003C/em\\u003E). \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDuring his duty shift that day, the Soviet Union\\u0026#39;s \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E early-warning satellite system made a detection that it erroneously interpreted as being an incoming ballistic missile launch from the United States. Thankfully, Petrov did not believe the warning to be authentic, and going against well established procedures, he refused to immediately notify his higher-ups in the military or Politburo political apparatus.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInterestingly, the reason Lieutenant Colonel Petrov did not believe the launch warning datastream coming in from the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E satellite was because luckily, he had actually been heavily involved in monitoring the development of the Soviet \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E early warning satellite constellation since its earliest design days (due to his rank and expertise, he was the top military liaison between the Soviet Air Defense Forces and the satellite design and testing team during the satellite\\u0026#39;s development), and he knew it was a very poor, unreliable system and could not be trusted because, contrary to what the Soviets publicly claimed about \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E at the time, it was highly prone to the threat of giving false-positive detections.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E satellite constellation did not actually detect the initial launch of a nuclear missile, but rather their orbital placement had these sats flying in highly elliptical \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit\\\"\\u003E\\u0026quot;Molniya\\u0026quot; orbits\\u003C/a\\u003E. This orbital profile allowed the satellites to observe the United States missile fields from high-oblique \\u0026quot;look angles\\u0026quot;, meaning they observed the target area from the side rather than overhead, looking for telltale infra-red signatures from the rocket motors. Rather than using radar or looking to detect a missile visually as it launched, the idea behind \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E was that once the nuclear missile had reached high altitude and its look angle breached the Earth\\u0026#39;s horizon in relation to the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E satellite, \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u0026#39;s\\u003C/em\\u003E onboard IR detection system would be able to pick out the heat signature from the rocket propelling the missile as it burned hot and bright against the cold stellar backdrop of space. Or, at least that is how it was supposed to work.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the case of this famous incident, there happened to be some high-altitude clouds above the US missile fields that this specific \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E sat was monitoring at the time, and due to the coincidental location of the sun at this instant, these cloud tops actually reflected the sunlight directly at the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E satellite onboard IR sensor array. The \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E satellite sensors detected that sudden infra-red bright spot \\u0026quot;bloom\\u0026quot; and, as it was programmed to do, the early-warning satellite interpreted that as an incoming missile and triggered the alarm.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EColonel Petrov was notified of the detection immediately since he was the senior duty officer at \\u003Cem\\u003ESerpukhov-15\\u003C/em\\u003E, and due to his past experience with and understanding of the very low reliability of the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E system, and from the fact that it was initially only detecting a single IR bloom (signifying only one initial missile detection as opposed to a salvo of many missiles), he concluded that it was most certainly a false positive detection situation. He decided to wait for radar confirmation (which of course never came) before going up the chain of command with the news, and part of the reason for that, Petrov has admitted since, is because he was not sure due to the political climate at the time how the Soviet Politburo political leadership in charge would react. At the time of this incident, tensions between the USA and USSR were rather high, and had been increased further just a few weeks prior because the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, killing 269 civilian passengers and crew.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn regards to this incident, it is worth noting that unlike the USA, the Soviets did not have extensive near-global radar confirmation capability at that time (and they really still don\\u0026#39;t). Petrov had to actually wait for quite awhile after the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E satellite sounded the initial incoming launch alarm that was triggered by its IR sensors before the nuclear missile (which did not exist) would have been close enough to Soviet-controlled airspace that they would have a direct line-of-sight on it to use radar to either confirm the incoming missile, or confirm the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E detection as a false positive. Obviously, that radar confirmation of an incoming missile never came because there was no incoming missile.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPetrov\\u0026#39;s real heroics in that incident was waiting for the radar confirmation before going up the chain of command. He has stated in interviews since that he was sure it was a false positive, and was not at all surprised when the radar screen never picked up a track of anything incoming. At the time, there was a lot of strife within the Soviet political apparatus, and Petrov was well aware of that in-fighting that was going on due to his position as a high-ranking military officer. He simply did not trust the ability of the Politburo higher-ups to (in just the few short minutes they would be given to react) properly weigh the evidence, take into account the reality that the \\u003Cem\\u003EOko\\u003C/em\\u003E constellation design flaws were so great that the satellites could not be trusted to provide accurate data, then make the correct decision and chose not to order a retaliatory strike before the supposed incoming non-existent missile struck Soviet territory.

Some photographers take this even further to the extreme and overexpose their images 3 or even 4 stops. Current digital technology would be nearly totally blown out white at that point.\\n\\n2. The larger 6x6 negative can easily be enlarged with very little loss in detail. Current small format (35mm) digital cameras are approaching this level of resolution with their high resolution sensors but I also own a Crown Graphic 4x5 large format camera. An 8x10 large format camera blows away even the most technologically advanced digital cameras when it comes to detail, resolution, and enlargement.\\n3. More pleasing grain structure. Film is a \\\"random\\\" medium in that it consists of light sensitive silver halide crystals suspended in a gelatin. The size and placement of these crystals can be varied thus creating a smoother, more pleasing grain than the digital noise caused by the grid of pixels in an image sensor.\\n4. You can get into film photography very cheaply! The cost of film and developing will add up quickly, yes, but a Canon AE-1 with a very sharp 50mm lens can be had for $100 or less.\\n\\nI'm a firm believer that the mission determines the the gear. I shoot both film and digital and I'm able to get some pretty decent images with both media but, all other things being equal, I mostly prefer film just because its more fun. I understand that's entirely subjective but I'm not a professional. For me photography is entirely for pleasure so I'm just gonna do what I enjoy most.

I usually tell them we played chess and drove around, no big deal. Maybe it\\u2019s worth putting some of it down, just so if my son ever thinks about joining up he knows what it\\u2019s like.\\n\\nI was in Germany in a Military Intelligence unit assigned as a German Linguist. I\\u2019d learned German at the Defense Language Institute and after an additional 6 months of training, deployed to one of my favorite countries in the world. Germany is incredible. It\\u2019s gorgeous. The people are fun, the food is amazing, and the girls don\\u2019t think their breasts need to be hidden. That alone makes it worth visiting during the summer, but living there was one of the best times of my life.\\nMilitary Intelligence is filled with bright people who managed to hide enough of their past that they could get a security clearance. Mine was Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (although when I was in, it was \\u201cSpecial Compartmentalized Intelligence). TS/SCI clearances are granted to people who the Army believes are capable of and willing to keep their goddam mouths shut. The idea is that if you\\u2019re in SIGINT (Signal Intelligence), you don\\u2019t need to know what the guys in HUMINT (Human Intelligence) are doing, so they compartmentalize information and assign a code word to that group. For example (and this isn\\u2019t a real word but you\\u2019ll get the idea), we might classify something \\u201cTop Secret \\u2013 Dog\\u201d to indicate it was viewable by people who were cleared for \\u201cDog\\u201d information. We were a bunch of snarky kids who looked down on the rest of the Army guys as a bunch of dumb-ass ground pounders. I came to appreciate them much later.\\n\\nOur job was to hang around the East German border and eavesdrop on their radio traffic and, using \\u201cdirection finding\\u201d, plot their location on a map. We would sit for hours, scanning through the radio spectrum and hoping to hear something fun. When we did, we\\u2019d alert our team leads and move on. Depending on what you heard, the person you told would change.\\n\\nSomething you probably don\\u2019t know \\u2013 every single person in my unit had the ability to get a message to the President within 15 minutes. It was called a \\u201cCRITIC\\u201d. The idea is that if we were to hear something so significant that it could be an act of war, the President had to know quickly. So the CIA came up with the idea that if you labeled a message \\u201cCRITIC\\u201d, it could get sent up to the President, bypassing the normal chain of command. As an example, if I had heard someone talking about a nuclear strike, I would send it up, mark it CRITIC, and it would go to the President. I never sent one personally, but knowing that you are only 15 minutes away from the leader of the Free World was a helluva piece of responsibility. Let\\u2019s be real \\u2013 if you were to do that on something that was bullshit, your career would be over. But you could.\\n\\nWorking in MI during the Cold War, even though it was at the end, was fascinating. That job ruined me for the rest of my life. You know how people are freaking out about Wikileaks now? \\u201cGood lord! Egad! Things aren\\u2019t as they seem!\\u201d Yeah. I know. They never were. What was so strange is that the information we saw every day was so clearly false and we just didn\\u2019t give a shit.\\n\\nBut I digress. Our battalion was full of German and Russian linguists, Direction Finding equipment, Jammers (basically radio stations that sent out white noise and disabled enemy communications), and a company of bad-asses whose job it was to protect us. We knew our jobs were ending \\u2013 what\\u2019s the point of trying to sneak around and listen to radio transmissions when you could just walk over the border and take a picture of what was happening? The brass knew we were probably going to deactivate the unit and get split up, so they looked the other way while we spent most of our time sweeping the motor pool and getting drunk. We\\u2019d show up at formation at 7:30am, go play soccer, then shoot the shit for a few hours until lunch, which lasted 2 hours. After lunch, we\\u2019d screw around for another couple hours then go home. I had an amazing apartment across from Sachsenhausen, the bar district mentioned in a few of my stories. It would be fair to say I was drunk every night. We repeated that routine every day until some fuckwit named Saddam Hussein decided to invade Kuwait.\\n\\nI\\u2019d never heard of the place, and frankly didn\\u2019t give a shit. Why should I care? It\\u2019s not like we would deploy, right? We were German and Russian linguists. What possible use would we be over there? All of our gear was cold weather; all of our equipment was painted green, brown, tan, and black. All of our camo was designed to shield us in forests. NO ONE IN IRAQ SPEAKS GERMAN OR RUSSIAN. All-in-all, sending our battalion would have been the stupidest thing anyone could think of. No one would waste Army resources in such a useless way.\\n\\nI had forgotten that we were in Military Intelligence. Everyone knows that is the original contradiction of terms. So, just like clockwork, our orders came down that we were heading over. We learned this in October/November of 1990 and we were to deploy in early January. By this time, the propaganda machines were in full swing and we were all firmly convinced that Hussein was the new Hitler. I\\u2019m not arguing he wasn\\u2019t a horrible person, but at the time we believed that one day, he just up and decided to attack Kuwait, a bunch of happy, peaceful, free-thinking freedom-loving people. When there is a gap in your knowledge, any information will fill it, so we believed this without question.\\n\\nAs our deployment date approached, the briefings started. They were mostly classified, but in some of them, they discussed what to do if we were captured. \\u201cTell them everything\\u201d, we were instructed. \\u201cAs quickly as we\\u2019re going to move, it won\\u2019t matter.\\u201d That made sense. We\\u2019d already done terrain studies and the place looked like a parking lot. \\u201cOh, and they\\u2019ll torture you using rats, metal bowls and blowtorches. So don\\u2019t try to resist.\\u201d\\n\\nWait. What?\\n\\nRats, metal bowls, and blowtorches? Yep. We were told that Hussein\\u2019s troops would cut a hole in our stomachs, trap a rat in a metal bowl, put the rat/bowl upside down on our belly then, using a blowtorch, heat the metal bowl until the rat burrowed into our stomachs in defense. So they\\u2019d done a pretty good job of scaring us, but the worst part was that we clearly had no clue what we were doing.\\n\\nThe company commander had the Platoon Sergeants put together a list of things they thought the troops could use, including sunglasses, compasses, etc. Then he gave them a credit card and sent them to the PX (Post Exchange \\u2013 basically like a Walmart) to get supplies. They came back and distributed the loot out to us and we sat there in shock. They had purchased us kids\\u2019 toys. The plastic wrist compass was \\u201cSuitable for ages 6+\\u201d.\\n\\nThe entire build-up to the deployment was a series of mishaps, cluster-fucks, and occasional successes. The closer we came to our ship date, the better things started to run, until we were ready. Well, mostly ready. The worst part of all was coming up.\\n\\nWe were told to head to the gym about a week or so before our flight and when we got there, the walls were ringed with tables, but to get to them, we had to go through a gauntlet of guys with needle guns. Yep. We had to get massive numbers of shots to supposedly keep us alive and free from disease so we could\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know, translate something? As I went from table to table, making sure all of my contact information was up to date, getting my bank accounts squared away and other administrative tasks, I got more and more irritated. It reached a head when I got to the table where I was told to make out a will.\\n\\nThis was where I finally broke. I refused. I said I didn\\u2019t need one. They argued. I remained steadfast. They prodded and pushed, got my Platoon Sergeant, but I wouldn\\u2019t do it. The line was backing up so they finally told me to keep moving, but they were pissed. I didn\\u2019t care. I wasn\\u2019t going to make a will because I would be coming back.\\n\\nMy final actions were to leave my apartment keys with a friend, kiss my girlfriend goodbye, get a really solid drunk on, and tell my German friends goodbye. That wasn\\u2019t fun. My military friends, mostly the wives of guys in my company, were okay with the whole thing. Oh, they cried and said we should keep our heads down and our powder dry, but they \\u201cgot it\\u201d.\\nIt was the German friends who were the worst. They didn\\u2019t want me to go, couldn\\u2019t understand why I was going, and looked at me with a combination of pity and disbelief.

This is surreal.\\n\\nI've climbed this tower before, but not by choice.\\n\\n*2010.* I live far out in the midwest. My girlfriend has signed up for this meditation retreat in the woods outside of Asheville. I keep asking her how she's gonna get down there, and she keeps joking she was gonna hitchhike. The day before she would have had to leave, I realize she's dead serious, and probably would have been carried off by some rando in the Kentucky backwoods on the way there. I was livid, but I cancelled work for a couple days and told her to be ready by 8 so we could get on the road. (I had an hour drive just to get to her.) I get there and her (and her friend) are not close to ready. We spend an hour packing before we are on the road.\\n\\nDrive down was tense to say the least. (Her) Best-friend/former-sometimes-lover who has more in common with her than I do is also mildly autistic. I'm still fuming at the casualness of the real-world planning of this while they have debates about logical fallacies and Kantian rhetoric, oblivious to my scruples, giddy and irreverent, all the way to North Carolina.\\n\\nWe get to the retreat center very late at night (for a retreat center.) Maybe 10:30. We seem like a herd of elephants bringing our things in. It's around this time it begins to dawn on me that I am sick, and not just a little bit. Probably bronchitis. I had planned to drive back the next day and had gigs the day after, so bronchitis would have to wait. We finally got some sleep.\\n\\nWhen I woke up in the morning, it was clear that I was not going anywhere. GF was adamant, and worried. I wished she'd have been as worried for her own safety in (not) making plans to get down here, but as she got permission for me to stay overweekend, I cancelled my gigs and obliged.\\n\\nWhich left a couple days to make the best of life in Asheville and environs. Went to a rock shop and a book store. Saw guitar busker on a street corner singing a Neil Young tune. At some point we stopped at a bakery in Weaverville, where I ate the best piece of chocolate cake I've ever eaten in my life. It was perfectly moist, soft as silk, decadent yet not heavy. I had one good bite left, that I saved, not wanting to be overfull. It melted in the car before our next stop.\\n\\nSo on what must have been my last day, I wanted to go up into the forest. We were a few short miles from some major nature, and as a runner and green geek I wanted to get to experience some of it. So, we got out a map, pointed to some green and drove there.\\n\\nMy 1990 Chevy Celebrity Station Wagon did not know what it was in for. A few dozen S-curves, *barely* 2 lanes wide, all the way up the mountain. I hadn't even really known we'd be going up a mountain. All I knew was this thing kept going up, and so was the dial reading my engine temperature. Soon I was just as worried that I'd crash into someone and fall of the mountain as I was that the engine would stop and give out. It hadn't occurred to me to stop and put my flashers on... there was no room! I suppose I could have made it happen. Instead I eyed nervously the needle that was now a quarter inch past the \\\"red zone.\\\"\\n\\nFinally, relief as the road straightened, the trees thinned out, and we could see where we were going.\\n\\nI took the first opportunity to park at what was quickly discovered to be a very upper-crust tourist restaurant (and motel?). Not the place for poor unwashed intelligentsia in an ancient Chevy. They must have had a Welcome Center or trinket shop that we considered while the car caught its breath. We snuck around to try to find a trailhead, but nothing doing. We were starting to feel defeated, and I for one, footing the car, the gas, and the responsibility of getting us home, and still aching from bronchitis... I was starting to feel like this was the worst kind of goose chase.\\n\\nBut I could not deny that I was on a mountain, and that it would be more sensible to press on and find a place to catch my senses than turn back now.\\n\\nThe road went on for another mile or so with maybe a lookout spot--or maybe not--but not much else in the way of exploration. Finally my girlfriend points out a service road jutting off to one side. The last thing I want to do stuck on a mountain is get arrested for trespassing on top of a mountain. Or get electrocuted on top of a mountain. But I'm to tired to protest, and it's at least a place to park.\\n\\nWe park at the bottom and walk up the service road. And there, at the top, is this exact lookout. Old, creaky terrifying. I am, at this point, the human embodiment of dismay. But up she goes, and, goddammit, up I go too.\\n\\nI tried not to look down. Or register the shaking of the vibrant steel. I just looked at one stair at a time and pushed until it seemed like they didn't want to go on anymore. I sat down on a stair and hugged a beam to regain a sense of solidity.\\n\\nAnd then I looked up and saw them. The green mountains. The sky was blue and bright, and white puffy clouds moved lazy shadows across the wrinkling expanse of green. I no longer heard anything they said. This moment was for me. All I had been through had given me this small moment in time, to see it all, for once, at once.\\n\\nOn the way down the mountain, my brakes put up as much of a fight as the engine had on the way up. I slept well that night. I left them the next morning, just as the retreat was beginning. I don't remember how they got back, but it didn't matter anymore.

Like Tinkers, this occupational name became an ethnic nickname in some places, and in some older works you'll see Roma and similar groups referred to as \\\"[Knackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knacker)\\\" broadly. \\n\\nMany nomadic groups in India historical did similar things. To [quote from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomads_of_India):\\n\\n\\u003ENomads are known as a group of communities who travel from place to place for their livelihood. Some are salt traders, fortune-tellers, conjurers, ayurvedic healers, jugglers, acrobats, story tellers, snake charmers, animal doctors, tattooists, grindstone makers, or basketmakers. All told, anthropologists have identified about 500 nomadic groups in India, numbering perhaps 80 million people\\u2014around 7 percent of the country's billion-plus population.[1]\\n\\n\\u003EThe nomadic communities in India can be broadly divided into three groups hunter gatherers, pastoralists and the peripatetic or non-food producing groups. Among these, peripatetic nomads are the most neglected and discriminated social group in India.[2] They have lost their livelihood niche because of drastic changes in transport, industries, production, entertainment and distribution systems.\\n\\nBut they're not alone. We normally think of nomads as the first two categories mentioned, either hunter-gatherers (like the San \\\"Bushmen\\\" of the Khalahari or many of the Plains Indians) or herdsmen (like the Arab Bedouins, the Masai in East Africa, or many of the Steppe societies). We're much less likely to think of nomads who exist in direct relationship with settled societies and fill a clear social niche providing services or access to trade goods or both. Even in Europe, you find several groups occupying the same social niche as the Roma without actually being Roma: [Irish Travelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers), the [Yenish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenish_people), [Scottish Travelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gypsy_and_Traveller_groups#Non-Romani_groups), [Norwegian Travelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Norwegian_Travellers), etc.  The various \\\"[Sea Gypsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Gypsies)\\\" groups of Southeast Asia fill a roughly analogous social niche. These groups sometimes overlap with the idea of \\\"[Middleman Minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleman_minority)\\\", also sometimes called market dominant minorities. \\n\\nAll these groups rely on extensive intraethnic networks and large intraethnic trust. In economic theory, one way that trust is generated within groups is if people have to give off \\\"[costly signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29)\\\" that they are trustworthy. Maintaining the \\\"strange customs\\\" of one of these groups (be they Jewish, or Roma, or any of the other service nomad groups) was one of the standard ways to show you were trustworthy to other members of the group, and that therefore they can safely start up trade relationships with you. Additionally, groups tended to have strong internal norms that would generate sanctions for people who violated them, again strengthening intragroup unity and letting strangers within the group more easily trust one another. These groups also tended to have long distance relationships so that there were fewer degrees of separation between people which also benefited intragroup trust. \\n\\nKeep in mind this is quite different from the mostly peasant societies that these service nomads lived among--one of the most striking things about peasant societies is that people are very tied to the land, and tend to have very geographically restricted networks with high amounts of trust within a village and less trust as one moves further away. I don't mean to say that all this cultural stuff was purely functional, and that we can just ignore its content (I'm Jewish--I think observant Judaism is ultimately more than just \\\"strong signaling\\\"), but just as these groups filled niches in agricultural peasant-based societies and fulfilled some social functions, their own norms and social patterns also had social functions. Unfortunately, as societies change, particularly in the transition from agricultural to industrial society, social patterns that were once advantageous--like nomadism and high degrees of in-group solidarity and out-group distrust--can end up arguably being disadvantages. \", \"edited\": 1462865874.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"body_html\": \"\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EGypsies, or Roma/Romani as they\\u0026#39;re more often called in academic literature today, played specific social functions within wider European societies.

Even in Europe, you find several groups occupying the same social niche as the Roma without actually being Roma: \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers\\\"\\u003EIrish Travelers\\u003C/a\\u003E, the \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenish_people\\\"\\u003EYenish\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gypsy_and_Traveller_groups#Non-Romani_groups\\\"\\u003EScottish Travelers\\u003C/a\\u003E, \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Norwegian_Travellers\\\"\\u003ENorwegian Travelers\\u003C/a\\u003E, etc.  The various \\u0026quot;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Gypsies\\\"\\u003ESea Gypsy\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u0026quot; groups of Southeast Asia fill a roughly analogous social niche. These groups sometimes overlap with the idea of \\u0026quot;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleman_minority\\\"\\u003EMiddleman Minorities\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u0026quot;, also sometimes called market dominant minorities. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAll these groups rely on extensive intraethnic networks and large intraethnic trust. In economic theory, one way that trust is generated within groups is if people have to give off \\u0026quot;\\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29\\\"\\u003Ecostly signals\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u0026quot; that they are trustworthy. Maintaining the \\u0026quot;strange customs\\u0026quot; of one of these groups (be they Jewish, or Roma, or any of the other service nomad groups) was one of the standard ways to show you were trustworthy to other members of the group, and that therefore they can safely start up trade relationships with you. Additionally, groups tended to have strong internal norms that would generate sanctions for people who violated them, again strengthening intragroup unity and letting strangers within the group more easily trust one another. These groups also tended to have long distance relationships so that there were fewer degrees of separation between people which also benefited intragroup trust. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EKeep in mind this is quite different from the mostly peasant societies that these service nomads lived among--one of the most striking things about peasant societies is that people are very tied to the land, and tend to have very geographically restricted networks with high amounts of trust within a village and less trust as one moves further away. I don\\u0026#39;t mean to say that all this cultural stuff was purely functional, and that we can just ignore its content (I\\u0026#39;m Jewish--I think observant Judaism is ultimately more than just \\u0026quot;strong signaling\\u0026quot;), but just as these groups filled niches in agricultural peasant-based societies and fulfilled some social functions, their own norms and social patterns also had social functions. Unfortunately, as societies change, particularly in the transition from agricultural to industrial society, social patterns that were once advantageous--like nomadism and high degrees of in-group solidarity and out-group distrust--can end up arguably being disadvantages. \\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\", \"quarantine\": false, \"subreddit\": \"MapPorn\", \"score_hidden\": false, \"name\": \"t1_d2yx7s3\", \"created\": 1462848756.0, \"author_flair_text\": null, \"link_url\": \"http://i.imgur.com/sCW51G1.jpg\", \"created_utc\": 1462819956.0, \"ups\": 415, \"mod_reports\": [], \"num_reports\": null, \"distinguished\": null}}, {\"kind\": \"t1\", \"data\": {\"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2ske1\", \"link_title\": \"Amazing custom steam shower tucked into the roof line of this renovated 1923 English Tudor home in Southern California.

Rich miner family aristocrat, Francisco I. Madero, suggests democracy, is laughed at nationally, but pressure from the US makes Diaz agree in an international media interview. He later backs out, and, using this as evidence that Diaz is putting the country's succession in danger, Madero convinces the rich to support him in a revolution. Trying to avoid a fight, Diaz resigns immediately and gives control of the country to Madero. Madero, attempting to forge a democracy, calls for elections and runs virtually unopposed. Wins.\\n\\nPhase 2: Diaz-loyalists led by Victoriano Huerta murder Madero and try to replicate Diaz's dictatorship. Only now they've lost the support of the northern aristocrats. Emboldened by the claudication of Diaz, who exiled himself in Paris, communists guerrillas to the south ally themselves with labor movements in central and Western Mexico, and initiate a fight with the government. The Huerta regime now has to fight the aristocrats of the north, and the communists of the South.\\n\\nPhase 3: After being defeated, the North and the South begin to fight against each other. The aristocrats eventually chose as leader Mr. Venustiano Carranza. To the South, Emiliano Zapata emerges as the communist's leader. To the North-West, criminal and bandit made general, Doroteo Arango, after re-naming himself \\\"Pancho Villa\\\", raises hell and gains a seat at the negotiating table between the 3 warring factions.\\n\\nPhase 4: Carranza arranges a meeting with the other two leaders (Villa and Zapata), and betrays them both. He murders them, and shortly thereafter proclaims himself Mexico's President, and his forces, Mexico's government. He then passes the Constitution of 1917, which still governs Mexico to this day. He invites the military forces of the other two leaders to join his government, or be persecuted and killed.\\n\\nPhase 5: Carranza is assasinated after playing foul in the elections, trying to hand-pick his successor. Alvaro Obreg\\u00f3n, a general who served with Carranza, but ran against his appointed successor, won the election aided by the use of Force. He was succeeded in the Presidency after a 4-year term by Plutarco El\\u00edas Calles. Calles, a believer that the profound influence that the Catholic Church had in Mexico was damaging to the country, outlawed its teachings and created the first nationwide Public Education system. As a result, the Church excommunicated anyone who was loyal to the government, inciting an insurgency known as the \\\"Cristero War\\\". When Obreg\\u00f3n tried to re-elect himself after Calles's term expired, he was shot and killed by a Cristero fanatic. Calles used the opportunity to elevate himself as a \\\"power behind the throne\\\", creating a political party that he controlled, and using the government to massacre Cristeros and other opposition.\\n\\nPhase 6: The party of Calles, known as the National Revolution Party, later renamed \\\"Mexican Revolution Party\\\", becomes the single party allowed to govern Mexico. However, after 6 years of Calles rule through 3 different puppets, opposition within the party brews and finally elects as candidate a General, Lazaro Cardenas.

The government organizes the economy around the nationalization of the oil industry, and the income from oil exports, a strategy that works well enough until oil peaks in the 1970s. Near the end of Cardenas's government, the Party is finally renamed the \\\"Party of the Institutional Revolution\\\" (PRI), which is still active until the modern day.

Rich miner family aristocrat, Francisco I. Madero, suggests democracy, is laughed at nationally, but pressure from the US makes Diaz agree in an international media interview. He later backs out, and, using this as evidence that Diaz is putting the country\\u0026#39;s succession in danger, Madero convinces the rich to support him in a revolution. Trying to avoid a fight, Diaz resigns immediately and gives control of the country to Madero. Madero, attempting to forge a democracy, calls for elections and runs virtually unopposed. Wins.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPhase 2: Diaz-loyalists led by Victoriano Huerta murder Madero and try to replicate Diaz\\u0026#39;s dictatorship. Only now they\\u0026#39;ve lost the support of the northern aristocrats. Emboldened by the claudication of Diaz, who exiled himself in Paris, communists guerrillas to the south ally themselves with labor movements in central and Western Mexico, and initiate a fight with the government. The Huerta regime now has to fight the aristocrats of the north, and the communists of the South.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPhase 3: After being defeated, the North and the South begin to fight against each other. The aristocrats eventually chose as leader Mr. Venustiano Carranza. To the South, Emiliano Zapata emerges as the communist\\u0026#39;s leader. To the North-West, criminal and bandit made general, Doroteo Arango, after re-naming himself \\u0026quot;Pancho Villa\\u0026quot;, raises hell and gains a seat at the negotiating table between the 3 warring factions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPhase 4: Carranza arranges a meeting with the other two leaders (Villa and Zapata), and betrays them both. He murders them, and shortly thereafter proclaims himself Mexico\\u0026#39;s President, and his forces, Mexico\\u0026#39;s government. He then passes the Constitution of 1917, which still governs Mexico to this day. He invites the military forces of the other two leaders to join his government, or be persecuted and killed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPhase 5: Carranza is assasinated after playing foul in the elections, trying to hand-pick his successor. Alvaro Obreg\\u00f3n, a general who served with Carranza, but ran against his appointed successor, won the election aided by the use of Force. He was succeeded in the Presidency after a 4-year term by Plutarco El\\u00edas Calles. Calles, a believer that the profound influence that the Catholic Church had in Mexico was damaging to the country, outlawed its teachings and created the first nationwide Public Education system. As a result, the Church excommunicated anyone who was loyal to the government, inciting an insurgency known as the \\u0026quot;Cristero War\\u0026quot;. When Obreg\\u00f3n tried to re-elect himself after Calles\\u0026#39;s term expired, he was shot and killed by a Cristero fanatic. Calles used the opportunity to elevate himself as a \\u0026quot;power behind the throne\\u0026quot;, creating a political party that he controlled, and using the government to massacre Cristeros and other opposition.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPhase 6: The party of Calles, known as the National Revolution Party, later renamed \\u0026quot;Mexican Revolution Party\\u0026quot;, becomes the single party allowed to govern Mexico. However, after 6 years of Calles rule through 3 different puppets, opposition within the party brews and finally elects as candidate a General, Lazaro Cardenas. Cardenas runs virtually unopposed and wins the Presidency. He promotes communist ideals and allies the Party to the International Socialist organization, but uses this rhetoric only as a facade to extend the Presidential period from 4 to 6 years, and create a system in which all labor and farmers and organized into unions, and all unions, along with government-sanctioned government lobbies (groups of industry leaders picked by the government to succeed in a particularly industry), negotiate within the party\\u0026#39;s bureaucracy, parallel to the government, to run the country and manipulate the vote.

That's not to say that there aren't many other differences, or that each individual civil or common law doesn't have its quirks or variations, or that there are no mixed law systems. \\n\\nThe first is to do with the law itself. Civil law is usually what we'd call codified, insofar as it is written explicitly as rules by a the legislative and/or judicial body(ies) of the country. Rules like \\\"Murder is defined as x and shall carry a sentence between y and z years\\\". Common law however is precedential in that the bulk of the laws are defined by precedent i.e. what other judges have deemed to be just in previous cases. When interpreting the law judges and legal representatives will call on what previous judges have decided and that can be used to support an argument whilst in civil law what other judges have decided is less important. Precedent can be overturned in common law but not easily. Another thing to note is that common law systems still have a form of codified law that comes from the legislature (the government body of elected officials) called legislation. When you see elected politicians debating new laws on television, it's legislation that they are debating, laws created by the government, these come in the form of statutes and are sometimes known as acts. Thus the term \\\"Act of Parliament\\\", which British people should be familiar with, in the US the \\\"Patriot Act\\\" was law put into force by the government rather than the judiciary. It is this legislation that in many ways forms the bones of the common law system, however, it is precedent that gives it body, determining the nuance of how it is to be interpreted and applied in different instances. When something new comes up, it often doesn't require that the government quickly draught and enact a new law to cover it, rather the matter plays out in court and a new precedent is set. The judges don't just make up new laws, but derive new precedents from previous legislation and precedent.\\n\\nThe second significant difference is how criminal trials function under each system. In common law systems trials are described as adversarial  . They are described so because the trial principally involves two parties, the prosecution and the defence, who try to demonstrate either the grounds for a belief that the law has been broken or demonstrate that there is a lack of grounds for a belief that a law has been broken. These two parties focus mainly on what can be called \\\"matters of fact\\\", each tries their best to bring the facts of the case to the light of day (albeit only those facts that support their own side), interviewing and cross-examining witnesses, submitting evidence, and putting forth arguments to the effect that x or y has occurred. In this situation the judge acts as a kind of referee, ensuring that neither side does anything unlawful or deceitful to gain an advantage in the proceedings. The judge also acts as a kind of library of legal expertise in \\\"matters of law\\\". Whether or not Mr Smith strangled his wife is a matter of fact, whether what he did do, once the facts are known, constitutes murder or manslaughter is a matter of law. None of this means that lawyers don't also involve themselves in matters of law, because they have to understand the law themselves to make the best arguments for or against the case, to portray the facts in a way that will achieve the best outcome for their side, and so they can also complain to the judge when they think a matter of law is being overlooked, but the judge has the final say on these matters. Once the trial comes towards its end the verdict is reached by a jury of your peers (ordinary people for you and me), the judge will advise the jury depending on how he sees the case and explain the complexities when necessary. Nonetheless, ultimately, the jury has the final say on guilty or not guilty (although again this is oversimplified because many lower courts in common law systems don't have juries and the judge(s) will be responsible for the verdict in a way far more similar to civil law e.g magistrates court). \\n\\nUnder civil law you have what we call an inquisitorial system. The ethos of this system can be captured by the Latin proverb \\\"Give me the fact, and I will give you the law\\\". Under an inquisitorial system the defence and prosecution play a diminished role, in some senses the roles of the judge and the lawyers is reversed. The lawyer for the defence still acts in an advisory role to their client, ensures that their client is being treated fairly (under common law a responsibility that falls heavily to the judge), and complains to the judge if they believe that not to be the case or they believe a matter of law is being overlooked. However, both matters of law and matter of fact fall under the judge's responsibilities. The judge will do things like interview and cross examine witnesses, attempting to be as objective as possible, and aim simply to find out the truth, rather than ask questions specifically contrived to support or weaken one particular side's argument. The lawyers still play a part, and they will consult with the judge and make clear which avenues of inquiry they wish to see pursued, but ultimately the judge has the final say. Furthermore, it is the judge, or more likely a panel of judges (if the trial is of significance), who will decide the verdict. There are typically no juries under this system (although some civil law countries do have them). There is also often a system somewhat similar to juries in the form of lay judges. A lay judge is a respected member of the community who does not come from a legal background, they are not a member of the bar and typically only have a minor amount of legal training (whatever is necessary to become a lay judge) or none at all. As I mentioned a big trial in a civil law country will have a panel of judges, sometimes 12 or more, usually in these countries the law will require a certain number of these be lay judges, so you might have a situation where the verdict is reached by a panel of 6 professional judges, and 6 lay judges. Another point of interest is that typically becoming a judge under an inquisitorial system is an entirely different career path to that of becoming a lawyer. After legal study graduates must decide whether they wish to pursue a career as a judge or as a lawyer, and moving between to two is rarely heard of, this is to keep the lawyers and the judges separate and prevent them from being subconsciously biased towards their old colleagues. In common law countries, of course, judges tend to be lawyers who became judges after reaching the height of their careers.\\n\\nUltimately both systems have pros and cons. The common law system is more rooted into the prioritisation of the minimisation of the power of the individual members of the judiciary (for whatever reason... parliament wasn't afraid of their power at all... cough), and keeping judges honest through this minimisation of power. It's much harder to blame a corrupt judge when all the judge does is oversee and advise (although I'm sure corrupt judges still manage it). However, this also means that in common law the quality of your legal representation can mean the difference between getting off Scot free and the harshest penalty the law can muster. That said, the judiciary as a whole, or at least the highest courts in the land, are more powerful in the sense they can define what the law will be in future through precedent.\\n\\nThe civil law system puts individual judges in a much more powerful position, which can be good in some cases. For example, under civil law a really good judge will demonstrate their skill by cross examining witnesses very fairly and objectively, however, under common law a really good prosecutor or lawyer for the defence will demonstrate their skill by cross examining witnesses in a way that rips apart their testimony and makes them look unreliable regardless of whether they're telling the truth or not. You have to remember that the goal of a lawyer is to win the case, regardless of anything, that's what they're paid to do, as long as they do so lawfully they're golden. A good judge on the other hand should simply want to see the truth out, and it won't matter to them what the outcome is in the slightest, they get paid the same and their career is safe regardless. Another assurance of this system is that you know the verdict will (probably) be reached primarily by people with enough legal understanding / intelligence of actually put their prejudice aside and understand the details of the case. A con of this system is that if you get a bad judge(s) or corrupt judge(s) then your life is in their hands, there is no chance that the jury will save you at the verdict. The judiciary as a whole, of course, has less power, and is subject to the government or whoever the government appoints to make the law.\\n\\nTo be fair, what makes a legal system good usually isn't the kind of law that it operates, but how it operates, some common law systems are great, some aren't, some civil law systems are great, some are down right terrible. The country you are tried in is going to make far more difference in regard to the quality of justice you receive than whether that country operates under civil or common law.\\n\\ntl;dr Codified law vs precedent, adversarial court vs inquisitorial court.\", \"edited\": 1460484472.0, \"author_flair_css_class\": null, \"downs\": 0, \"body_html\": \"\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"md\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EThere are two highly significant fundamental differences between common law practices and civil law (sometimes called Roman law) practices.
