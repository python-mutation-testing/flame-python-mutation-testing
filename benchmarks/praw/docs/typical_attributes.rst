**Typical Attributes**

.. note::

    This table describes attributes that typically belong to objects of this class. PRAW
    dynamically provides the attributes that Reddit returns via the API. Since those
    attributes are subject to change on Reddit's end, PRAW makes no effort to document
    any new/removed/changed attributes, other than to instruct you on how to discover
    what is available. As a result, this table of attributes may not be complete. See
    :ref:`determine-available-attributes-of-an-object` for detailed information.

    If you would like to add an attribute to this table, feel free to open a `pull
    request <https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/pulls>`_.
